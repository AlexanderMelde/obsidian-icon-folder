## How to use

It is pretty simple to add a icon to your folder:

1. Right click on the folder where you want to add an icon
2. Select the `Change Icon` menu item (prefixed with a `#` icon)
3. Select the icon you want and profit!

To delete an icon, you just need to click on the `Delete Icon` (prefixed with a `trash` icon) menu item.
